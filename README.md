# FIRST r/place Overlay
Thanks for helping everyone!
This script uses the chrome extension tampermonkey in order to overlay r/place with a dot cooresponding to the 
correct color for the FIRST logo build!

##Installation Steps

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) to run the script

2. install the script at this link: [https://github.com/7603J/FIRST-r-place-Overlay/raw/main/FIRST%20r-place%20overlay.user.js]
If this works correctly, Tampermonkey will open and offer to install the script. Click install

3. Open [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/?cx=1163&cy=1611&px=26), if already opened, refresh the page.
There should now be an overlay! This will show the correct color dots over the corresponding pixels. Thank you
for contributing!
